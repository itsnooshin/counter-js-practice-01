# overview
The project is part of the freecodecamp project. For projects with Javascript, I didn't know how to begin, so I started with freecodecamp and used these tutorials. In this project, There are three options: increasing, resetting, and decreasing. The number will increase when you click on decreasing, and it will also increase when you click on resetting all numbers to 0 and then decreasing the number. For each position, I also add three colors: green when the number is greater than zero, blue when it's zero, and red when it's decreasing.
